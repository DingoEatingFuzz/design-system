## 4.6.0

### Deprecated

In this version we have replaced the existing Modal sub-components with the equivalent sub-components from the [DialogPrimitive](/utilities/dialog-primitive) component (shared with the [Modal](/components/modal) component). They're not used anymore and for this reasons we consider them deprecated, and they'll be removed in our next major release.

To do the migration, if you use the `<Hds::Modal::***>` invocation:

| Deprecated:           | Replace with:                  |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|
| `Modal::Header`      | `DialogPrimitive::Header`      |
| `Modal::Body`        | `DialogPrimitive::Body`        |
| `Modal::Footer`      | `DialogPrimitive::Footer`      |

If instead you use the `(component hds/modal/***)`:

| Deprecated:              | Replace with:                     |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `hds/modal/header`      | `hds/dialogprimitive/header`      |
| `hds/modal/body`        | `hds/dialogprimitive/body`        |
| `hds/modal/footer`      | `hds/dialogprimitive/footer`      |

In the refactoring we have been able to maintain the existing CSS class names, to avoid breaking existing tests and CSS overrides in the consumers' codebases.
